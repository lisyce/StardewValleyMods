# Enemy of the Valley

Enemy of the Valley is a gameplay and content expansion that unlocks the potential of negative friendship with NPCs!
Become enemies with that one character you just don't get along with. Take it a step further and become archenemies, swearing your undying distaste for each other!
Features new dialogue, events, UI, and more!

(As you may be able to guess, this mod contains rude dialogue. If you don't want NPCs to covertly (or overtly) insult you after you choose to antagonize them, you may opt to not download this mod. This mod is still SFW and does not contain any swearing.)

## For Mod Authors
