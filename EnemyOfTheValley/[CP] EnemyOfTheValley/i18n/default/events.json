  "Events.Haley-2.3": "Your shirt and shoes don't match at all! Is this how all farmers are?",
  "Events.Haley-2.4": "Great, you do understand you need help!$h",
  "Events.Haley-2.5": "I'm just being brutally honest. Someone had to tell you!",
  "Events.Haley-2.6": "Anyway, I've got things to do. Have fun with Emily.$3",

  "Events.Haley-2.Fork.0": "So anyway, did you need something else from me?",

  "Events.Haley-6.0": "I'm a bit surprised you decided to come, Haley. But welcome!$h",
  "Events.Haley-6.1": "I figured I'd give it a go since it's community day and all. I invited @, too!",
  "Events.Haley-6.2": "Ah, they're here!$h",

  "Events.Haley-6.4": "It might get pretty sweaty working out in that mask!$1",
  "Events.Haley-6.5": "I will say it's a bit... off-putting. Where did you even get it?$2",
  "Events.Haley-6.6": "I thought it was costume day!",
  "Events.Haley-6.7": "What is this, Haley? Some kind of sick joke?",
  "Events.Haley-6.8": "What are you talking about? That's so silly!$1",

  "Events.Pierre-2.5": "I also got a coupon in the mail! I'd like to use it today.",
  "Events.Pierre-2.6": "How come Gus got a better discount than me? Mine's only 25%!",
  "Events.Pierre-2.7": "Hmm.... must have just been a data entry error. But I can only honor the 25% off discount for you.",
  "Events.Pierre-2.8": "What? I can't give out discounts that aren't reflected in my system!#$b#Just be happy you got a discount at all...$3",
  "Events.Pierre-2.9": "Anyway, here's your change. I appreciate your business, but sometimes the customer isn't always right.$3",
  "Events.Pierre-2.Fork.0": "Hmm... That's odd. I don't remember sending you a coupon.",
  "Events.Pierre-2.Fork.1": "Sorry, I can't honor the coupon. It's not reflected in my system.#$b#I can give you a free pantry staple as consolation, though.",

  "Events.Pierre-4.1": "Well, of course you know I resell what you sell me. That's just business.#$b#But, it appears our neighbors seem to think that it's me who grows all this!$1",
  "Events.Pierre-4.2": "Well, I'm not the one who's spreading the rumors!$1",
  "Events.Pierre-4.3": "What, do you think we're more than just business competitors?#$b#I'm not afraid of you.$3",
  "Events.Pierre-4.4": "Anyway, let's not get too heated. Shall we get back to business?",
  "Events.Pierre-4.5": "Why would you lie like that?",
  "Events.Pierre-4.6": "Careful. You don't want to get on my bad side.",

  "Events.Shane-2.0": "What do you want now? You keep bothering me for no reason. Leave me alone!$a",

  "Events.Elliott-2.8": "I bet they're right.",
  "Events.Elliott-2.9": "Well, writing a novel is a lot of work...",

  "Events.Lewis-2.4": "Look, I've been mayor for a long time. Nobody ever runs against me. I like to think I do a good job.",
  "Events.Lewis-2.5": "What I don't understand is why you seem to have a problem with me!$3",
  "Events.Lewis-2.6": "I just think there's some policies you could improve.",
  "Events.Lewis-2.7": "Even I could be a better mayor than you!",
  "Events.Lewis-2.8": "To be honest, I just don't like your moustache.",
  "Events.Lewis-2.9": "Sigh... well there are better ways to communicate that, you know.$2",
  "Events.Lewis-2.10": "Well, it's not election season any time soon.#$b#But between you and me, I don't think the residents of Pelican Town would even think of voting for you.$5",
  "Events.Lewis-2.11": "That's absolutely uncalled for!$4",

  "Events.Lewis-6.0": "Ahem... let's get started, shall we?#$b#Thank you all for coming today. I wanted to discuss incentives to improve businesses in Pelican Town.#$b#You all are wonderful additions to the economy. I've drawn up this list of potential financial credits; take a peek!$h",
  "Events.Lewis-6.1": "Wow, this looks great! Maybe I'll be able to buy those new boots I've been eyeing!$h",
  "Events.Lewis-6.2": "The funds are supposed to actually go towards your business expenses, you know..$6.",
  "Events.Lewis-6.3": "I'm sure I could find a way to write boots off as a business expense... I work with animals, you know.$2",
  "Events.Lewis-6.4": "Oh, @! We were just... um...$3#$b#...discussing some boring business regulations.",
  "Events.Lewis-6.5": "A town hall meeting... and I wasn't invited?",
  "Events.Lewis-6.6": "What did you just hide?",
  "Events.Lewis-6.7": "I sent you an invite, but you must not have checked your mail.$3#$b#You shouldn't be so careless if you want to be involved in things like this.$3",
  "Events.Lewis-6.8": "Nothing! I was just showing my grocery list to Pierre and discussing his plans for the next season!$3",
  "Events.Lewis-6.9": "Fine! We were having a town hall meeting regarding some new policies.$3#$b#I specifically invited people with a knowledge of business and a *positive* presense in town.$3",
  "Events.Lewis-6.10": "I think I'm plenty positive!",
  "Events.Lewis-6.11": "Is this personally motivated? I know you don't like me!",
  "Events.Lewis-6.12": "Well, I didn't see fit to have you participate in this meeting. And whether I like you or not has nothing to do with it!$3",
  "Events.Lewis-6.13": "Um... is there something going on between you two?$2",
  "Events.Lewis-6.14": "Never mind that! Everyone can just go. We'll talk about this another time.$3",
  "Events.Lewis-6.15": "Now! Everyone get out of my house!$4",
  "Events.Lewis-6.16": "Lewis didn't take kindly to the crashing of his secret meeting...",
  "Events.Lewis-6.17": "Hopefully this all blows over soon...",

  "Events.Demetrius-2.0": "Oh, it's @. Maru and I were just doing some lab work on samples of moss from the nearby forest.",
  "Events.Demetrius-2.1": "Maru, I think I left some of our samples out front. Could you please run and get them?",
  "Events.Demetrius-2.2": "Sure, Dad! I'll check by the garage. I think we might have forgotten them there.",
  "Events.Demetrius-2.3": "Come closer, @.",
  "Events.Demetrius-2.4": "No, come *all* the way over here.",
  "Events.Demetrius-2.5": "I sense that you might have some reservations about me. I've been collecting data on our interactions and only 3 of the last 10 were friendly.",
  "Events.Demetrius-2.6": "Are you sure? I think we've been getting along great",
  "Events.Demetrius-2.7": "I'm always busy when you try and talk to me. I don't have time.",
  "Events.Demetrius-2.8": "Hmmm... perhaps my data collection methods have some flaw?$3",
  "Events.Demetrius-2.9": "I'm not sure that's the case. My records show you initiated 90% of the most recent interactions we had.$5",
  "Events.Demetrius-2.10": "Anyway, @, I wanted to discuss something with you.$5#$b#I'm starting to be mistrustful of your character. I'm sure you know my Maru is very important to me.$4#$b#I think it would be in your best interests to not become involved with her.$4",
  "Events.Demetrius-2.11": "Demetrius looks at you pointedly...",
  "Events.Demetrius-2.12": "Oh! My samples are done. I've got to check on them.#$b#You should get going before she's back.$4",
  "Events.Demetrius-2.13": "Don't forget what I said!"
