## Configuration

All captions in this mod can be toggled on/off by the player via the config. It is recommended that players use
[Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) for this purpose. Unsure how to disable a certain caption that's playing? Search
for the caption's text in [the list of captions](docs/caption-list.md) to figure out what category it's under.

Additional configuration exists for changing the color of certain captions, changing the positioning of the captions
on-screen, and more!
